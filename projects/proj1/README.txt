README Contents:
- Your name and NYU email address.

- The state of your work. Did you complete the assignment? If not, what is missing? Be specific. If
your assignment is incomplete or has known bugs, I prefer that students let me know, rather than let
me discover these deficiencies on my own.

- Any other resources you may have used in developing your program.

- Justify your design decisions. Why did you write your program the way you did? If you feel that your
design has notable strengths or weaknesses, discuss them.
